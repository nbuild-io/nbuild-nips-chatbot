You have to use Expo to build our React Native app for iOS, Android and Web. Expo provides a set of tools and services that simplify the development process, allowing us to focus on building features rather than dealing with native code.

You can learn more about Expo by visiting its [official documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/).

You have to use pnpm for managing our dependencies in this Expo code base. If you are not familiar with pnpm, you can learn more about it in its [official documentation](https://pnpm.io/).

You also have to code with TypeScript for type safety. You must apply TypeScript best practices when writing code in this code base. If you are not familiar with TypeScript, you can learn more about it in its [official documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/).

You have to implement domain-driven design (DDD) principles when writing and structuring our code. This means organising our code around the business domain, focusing on the core logic and behaviors rather than technical details. You can learn more about DDD in our [collection of articles](https://medium.com/@AndiReuter/list/domain-driven-design-b4ec21b36221) and in the [official DDD reference eBook](https://www.domainlanguage.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/DDD_Reference_2015-03.pdf). You don't have to apply all DDD principles, but you should focus on the core concepts such as entities, value objects, aggregates, repositories, domain services and use cases. But you can ignore application services, domain events and bounded contexts. You have to integrate this [NPM package](https://github.com/andreasreuter/js-domain-principles/pkgs/npm/js-domain-principles) and look into the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/andreasreuter/js-domain-principles) with core typings of domain-driven design principles.

You have to use Recoil to manage the sate of our Expo app. You can learn more about Recoil in its [official documentation](https://recoiljs.org/).
